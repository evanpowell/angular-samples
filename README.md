# AngularSamples

This project serves to demonstrate a few of Angular's core features, along with some slightly more advanced concepts.

Concepts covered include:
- Client-side routing
- Template driven forms
- Reactive forms
- Getting and posting data via services
- Custom directives
- Custom pipes (to transform AND parse!)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
